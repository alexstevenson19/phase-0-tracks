## Release 1 - Find the Thing

2. Key design philosophies of Linux
 * One design philosophy of Linux is that it is designed to be open and give the user access to 'everything'. It is assumed the user is computer literate.
 * As well, Linux has a modular design. Self contained components work with each other to form the whole.
 * To that end, clarity is important to keep everything running smoothly.

3. A Virtual Private Server (VPS) falls between a shared server and a dedicated server. Essentially you get your own private area on a larger server.
 * It will have its own operating system, disc space, and bandwidth.
 * You have root access privilages. 
 * Easy to upgrade.
 * Usually you will be on better equipment.

4. Dangers of being logged in as root.
 * You have access to everything, without safety checks. Ignoring malicious viruses and similar threats, as the root user you can cause damage if you mistype something or aren't paying attention in other ways.
 * It erases most, if not all, security features that are in place to protect your system.


## Release 2 - Find the Thing

* OnMouseWheel - in the case of the chameleon using the mouse wheel (or equivalent) to adjust the color could be fun.
* Opacity - I tend to find transelucent objects useful in design projects, so if there is a consistent and accurate version across browsers I'm interested. (Though I'm not seeing much of a change by just changing levels in the inspector.)
* webkit Ruby Position - It seems as though this is an experimental technology according to Modzilla. Hopefully becomes more stable as things go forward.
* onRateChange - seems like it could be useful (not in CSS).
* stopColor - in the case of this chameleon, can it really stop him from changing?
