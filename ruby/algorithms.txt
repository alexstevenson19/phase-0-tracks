# Elevator Robot Algorithm (12 story building)


# (Assuming the robot has successfully reached the lobby)

# Go to elevator call buttons.

# Determine which direction to go. If up=true, press “up” button. If down=true, press “down” button.

# When doors open, walk forward five steps. Turn left (counter clockwise) 90°. Walk two steps. Turn left (counter-clockwise) 90°. Place finger/button-presser at 0,0 point (G button.)

# [The elevator button grid is 3 columns wide and 4 rows tall. The 1st floor/G button is the bottom left-most button.]

# Determine what floor to travel to, or get input from user. 
# ex. puts “What floor?” 
# floor = gets.chomp
# if floor.to_i > 12, puts “The building isn’t that tall, please enter floor again.”
# else 
# press the corresponding floor.to_i button according to grid layout.

# grid layout example - if the desired floor is 8, move finger/button-presser up two rows, then move right one column, press button.

# Return finger/button-presser to body side. Monitor altimeter and gyro to elevator motion and elevation.

# When elevator stops, wait for door to open.

# Turn left (counter-clockwise) 90°. Walk two steps. Turn right (clockwise) 90°. Walk five steps to exit the elevator.
