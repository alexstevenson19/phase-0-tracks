	Make a Olympus Sound File organizer.
	I have digital recordings of my travels in Japan, but due to the nature of the voice recorder file system, files
	from similar time frames are broken up between five folders. While I have labeled the files themselves, I still have to 
	search through the folders to find them.

	Make a Ruby interface to store file information in a data base. 
	Table categories: theme, when, location, keywords, file folder
	Have a set number of themes to choose from.
	When: year and (month(s) or season)
	Location: an wide variable going from country down to district/neighborhood. ex. Yamagata, or Shimokitazawa, or Golden Gai
	Keywords: also very wide open.
	There are only five file folders listed A to E, so they this information can be kept in a small database by itself, and will be a one to five relationship with the main database.
