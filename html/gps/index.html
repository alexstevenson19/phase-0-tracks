<!-- HTML Semantic tags are useful for accessibility need, or readers in general. They help produce a clearer picture for users who receive page content with those devices, as well as helping other coders make sense of a page.
Browsers will display elements in order of Header, Body, Footer.
It is more adaptable than I realized, and I think I will use snippets for sure in the future as I learn my habits and preferences.
Still remembering the various order of things, and little details, such as what needs to go in quotes vs a space or something else. I'm hoping practice will work a lot of it out and make things automatic.
